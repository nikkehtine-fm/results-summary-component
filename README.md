## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   [x] View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-   [x] See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
-   [x] **Bonus**: Use the local JSON data to dynamically populate the content

Things yet to implement:

-   [ ] Box shadow for root card
-   [ ] Animations
    -   [ ] Button hover transition
    -   [ ] Progress bars loading animations
    -   [ ] Counting up the score on result card

Things I _might_ implement:

-   [ ] Interactive values (with hooks)
-   [ ] Action on button click (either one of):
    -   Overlay
    -   Rendering a page

### Continued development

Things I have to still learn:

### Useful resources

-   [React Docs](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) - The official React docs are well written and a very good resource for learning React.
-   [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) - TypeScript docs are another invaluable resource for working with TypeScript.
-   [Passing props to a component in React Docs](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) - Passing props to a child component gave me a bit of a headache, but looking into the docs cleared most things up for me.
-   [Rendering lists in React Docs](https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists)
-   [Working with JSX in TypeScript Docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html) - This page in the TS documentation explains various ways to best utilize TypeScript in JSX.
-   [CSS Progress Bar Tutorial by Web Dev Simplified on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=basf1lH1H-E) - This is an amazing channel, and the tutorial was informative and easy to follow.
